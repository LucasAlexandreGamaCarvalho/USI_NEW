 USB Small Install - New Version

This script emerged from the frustration of repeatedly reinstalling Ubuntu through the conventional, albeit more intricate, methods. Instead, I sought a lighter, more enjoyable approach. Leveraging Ubuntu Base 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa), this script is open for your use, allowing easy adaptation to your specific requirements.

Gone are the days of painstakingly configuring the environment and applying customizations every time I switched hard drives. Now, I simply boot into the live system and execute the script after selecting the target disk. This flexibility proves particularly handy when deploying this environment onto an external USB stick or drive.

I prefer steering clear of the standard Ubuntu installation due to its feature-rich nature, often exceeding my specific needs. Hence, I opted for Ubuntu Base, a minimal package. However, the repetitive process of referencing an old TXT file and executing the same steps led me to conceptualize this script. With the recent SSD upgrades on my workstations and notebook, I decided to tackle my inertia head-on. The result? This straightforward, no-frills "pain"-relieving script designed to simplify the process, built entirely in Shell Script without unnecessary complexities.

Update: I've now included a local folder in the repository for a version tailored to machines already running Ubuntu. If you opt for SYSTEM76 support, it'll even tweak the fonts and wallpaper for a touch of personalization! ;-)
